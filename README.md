Robbo
=====

Old school Atari games Robbo and Robbo Constructor resurected in a browser with the power of CoffeeScript.
The orginal game was created by [Janusz Pelc](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Pelc_(programista)) for [8-bit Atari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari) computer. Published by [Laboratorium Komputerowe Avalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK_Avalon) in 1989 (Robbo Constructor 1990).

I recreated this game using CoffeScript as a part of my CoffeeScript training. The first version of the game was simply an excercise and demo presenting power of CoffeeScript class system. Once I discovered hwo much fun I get building it I've continued work on the game as my pet project.

Game is designed as stand alone HTML page. It means you can just checkout this repository and open game/robbo.html and play my last definition of levels. 

Levels and games are stored in game/config/universe.js. You can use Robbo Constructor to edit games and planets.
