Robbo
=====

Old school Atari games Robbo and Robbo Constructor resurected in a browser with power of CoffeeScript.
The orginal game was created by [Janusz Pelc](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Pelc_(programista)) for [8-bit Atari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari) computer. Published by [Laboratorium Komputerowe Avalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK_Avalon) 

I recreated this gmae using CoffeScript as a part of my CoffeeScript training. The first version of the game was simply an excercise and demo presenting power of CoffeeScript class system. Once I discovered hwo much fun I get building it I've continued work on the game as my pet project.
